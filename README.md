# Research Software - Publication and Sustainability

To gain a basic understanding about the publishing behaviour and the sustainability of research software is the objective of this project. The initial step is the identification of research software. Repositories, referencing a research publication or that are referenced by a research publication, are considered as candidates. Currently the scope encompasses repositories that are hosted on GitHub and research publications that are released in the ACM digital library (ACM) or on the arXiv e-print repository (arXiv). In the following steps, the gathered candidates are searched for research software, that is analyzed descriptively afterwards.

## Prerequisites:
  - Python 3
  - MongoDB  
  - Jupyter Notebook  
  - Packages (see requirements.txt)  
  
## Getting started:  
  - Create a virtual environment  
  - Install required packages (pip install requirements.txt) 
  - Specify parameter in the configuration file  
  - Run the Jupyter Notebooks
